Interactive-Resume
==================
This is a project I put together on http://josephrogina.com so I wouldn't have to keep squeezing irrelevant information onto a single page. 
The resume page is generated on the fly by php that pulls from a MySQL database. The CSS is basic, but I’m a developer, not a designer.
I may go back and add a more responsive design for mobile in the future, but for now it’s setup for a desktop browser.
